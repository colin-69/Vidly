# Vidly

Welcome to Vidly, a movie rental service created in Node.Js. This appliation was my first exposure to creating API's along with using Postman, Mongodb, Google Cloud Services, and Heroku.
In this application I leanred about GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. API's were created for the users, returns, rentals, movies, customers, and authentication. 
I also learned about middleware and created cusotm middleware that is used.
